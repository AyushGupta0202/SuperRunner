## Architecture üìê

### Design Patterns & Principles

- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with multi-module setup
- **UI Pattern**: MVI (Model-View-Intent) and using ViewModel and StateFlow/Flow for UI state management
- **Reactive Programming**: Kotlin Coroutines & Flow
- **Dependency Injection**: Using Koin
- **Single Activity**: Using Jetpack Navigation
- **State Hoisting**: Composable state management
- **Convention Plugins**: Custom gradle plugins for dependency management

### Project Structure
The project follows a clean, modular architecture:

- `app/` - Main phone application module
- `analyitcs/` - Analytics module
- `wear/` - Wear OS application module
- `core/` - Shared core functionality
  - `presentation/`
  - `domain/`
  - `data/`
  - `utils/`
  - `notification/`
  - `connectivity/`
  - `database/`
- `auth/` - Authentication feature module
- `run/` - Run tracking feature module

- Each module has its own `presentation/`, `domain/`, `data/` and `utils/` folders.
